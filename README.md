This project focuses on facial emotion recognition using deep learning techniques to classify seven key emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality. 
A custom LeNet- based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed and trained on a labeled dataset. Additionally, pretrained models like VGG19 and MobileNet were used for feature
extraction followed by Softmax classification. For face detection, both Haar Cascade and YOLOv3 techniques were implemented and evaluated. The LeNet model achieved an accuracy of 50.46%,
while MobileNet outperformed others with 62.43%, and VGG19 achieved 50.6%. The system demonstrates robust performance and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications in 
human-computer interaction, emotion-aware systems, mental health monitoring, and other smart environments requiring emotional intelligence.
